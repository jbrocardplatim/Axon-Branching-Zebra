# AxonesZebra
Java code for Fiji to quantify axonal branching from motor neuron zebrafish embryo

Some parameters may be set while using the macro:
* "Width" = width over which axonal branching will be considered
* "Max height" = height of the longest axonal shaft
* "Min height" = height below which axonal shafts won't be considered for further analysis
